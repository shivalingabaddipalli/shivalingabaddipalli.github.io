excerpt: 'This study addresses the effect of infill strength, infill’s nonlinearity, and seismic design level on the blast response of buildings through deterministic and probabilistic assessments using an uncoupled approach. Moreover, the present work provides insights through detailed numerical study which is required prior to planning and designing the suitable blast-mitigation measures. Further, the proposed scaled distances can be used for rapid blast risk assessment of masonry-infilled RC buildings.'
