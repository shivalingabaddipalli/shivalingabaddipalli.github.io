I love to go on treck and hike. IIT Mandi lies in the heart of himalayas with enriched biodiversity, and rivers etc.,. The big stable mountains made me more silent, stable, and concious over the time. I also made good friends who enjoys the treck.

I also love playing cricket and badminton. I sincerely believe that sports teach us persistance, self-discipline, mental toughness and resilience. It helps to improve overall personality development. All these also reflect in other parts of your life.
