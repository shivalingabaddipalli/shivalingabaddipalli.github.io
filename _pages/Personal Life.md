* I love to go on treks and hike. IIT Mandi lies in the heart of the Himalayas with enriched biodiversity, rivers, etc. The presence of big stable mountains made me more silent, stable, and conscious over time. I also met some very good people who enjoy trekking.

* I also love playing cricket and badminton. I believe sports teach us persistence, self-discipline, mental toughness, and resilience. It helps to improve the overall personality development. All these also reflect in other parts of your life.
