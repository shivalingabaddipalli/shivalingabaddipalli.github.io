I am Shivalinga Baddipalli. I am a curious researcher with a strong interest in conducting fundamental scientific research and contributing to the growth of human knowledge. I possess high persistence and adaptability in working through challenges and setbacks. I believe that â€œSweat in practice is better than blood on the battlefield. 

Currently, I am looking for a Ph.D. position in the broad domain of structural dynamics, earthquake engineering, and blast engineering. I am also interested in diversifying my research into new challenging areas of structural engineering, providing an opportunity to contribute to safe, resilient, cost-effective, and sustainable solutions.
