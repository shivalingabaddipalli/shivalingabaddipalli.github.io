Currently, I am looking for a Ph.D. position in the broad domain of structural dynamics, earthquake engineering, and blast engineering. I am also interested in diversifying my research into new challenging areas of structural engineering, providing an opportunity to contribute to safe, resilient, cost-effective, and sustainable solutions.
