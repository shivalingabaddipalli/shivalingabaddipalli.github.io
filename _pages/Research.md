Description
======
This study aims to investigate the influence of the masonry infill strength on the blast performance of the masonry infilled RC buildings designed to withstand different levels of seismic demand. In view of the above-mentioned research gaps, the specific objectives of this study are: (i) to examine the effect of the infill’s nonlinearity on the blast response of the earthquake-resistant RC buildings, and (ii) to probabilistically assess the effect of infill panel strength and seismic design level on the blast response of the considered buildings subjected to the surface burst. It is observed that the consideration of infill’s nonlinearity influences the blast response up to a certain scaled distance only. Moreover, increasing the infill strength does not necessarily enhance the blast performance; however, designing the building to higher seismic demand results in improved blast performance. In addition, proper insight into seismic design level and infill strength of any RC building is required prior to plan and design them with suitable blast-mitigation measures.
