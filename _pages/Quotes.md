“Engineering is the art of modelling materials we do not wholly understand, into shapes we cannot precisely analyse so as to withstand forces we cannot properly assess, in such a way that the public has no reason to suspect the extent of our ignorance.” 
― AR Dykes

“Engineering problems are under-defined, there are many solutions, good, bad and indifferent. The art is to arrive at a good solution. This is a creative activity, involving imagination, intuition and deliberate choice.”
― Ove Arup

“All models are wrong. Some models are useful.”
― George E. P. Box 

“Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.” 
― Albert Einstein

“One of the principles I have learnt has been that the effect of scaling-up the size of structural components has hidden pitfalls…it really is the case that, in many aspects of structural engineering, size does matter.”
― F. M. Burdekin

“In the behaviour of structures, truth can usually be found only by testing and observing genuine structural members built with the materials as they are, with imperfections which cannot be avoided.”
― Fritz Leonhardt 

“The fact that engineers get fulfilment from their work supports the view that creative engineering work can be satisfying, perhaps even as satisfying as writing, painting or performing music. Dare we even suggest that the pleasure derived from each can be identical, at least for the practitioner!”
― H.P. J. Taylor

“The monotony and solitude of quiet life stimulates the creative mind.”
― Albert Einstein

“Dream is not what you see in sleep, Dream is something which doesn't let you sleep.”
― Albert Einstein
