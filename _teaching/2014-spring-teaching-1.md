I was assigned a teaching assistantship in the IC (Institute Core) course "IC240-Mechanics of Rigid Bodies" under Dr Rajesh Ghosh. The primary duties of the course include conducting/assisting in tutorial sessions, assignments, and grade evaluation. This was a common course for first-year students, where the strength of this course was 250 students. Ten TAs was involved in making it to ten groups.
